# NFT Gallery

This week's project is about creating an NFT gallery that fetchs and shows:
- All NFTs owned by an address
- All NFTs of a given NFT collection's address
- All NFTs owned by an address that are part of a given NFT collection's address

This is done by leveraging the [Alchemy NFT API](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/nft-api-endpoints).
